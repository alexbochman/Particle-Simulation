# Particle Simulation

Started this project over the summer of 2020 following a Udemy.com course for C++. This project was the final section
for the beginner course.

The course instructor used SDL as his development library, while I used SFML. I chose to use a different development library to
(somewhat) challenge myself by differentiating the tools available to me as opposed to the exact tools available to the course instructor.
